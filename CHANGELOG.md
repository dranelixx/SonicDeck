# Changelog

All notable changes to SonicDeck are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Low-latency audio engine** with fixed buffer size (256 samples) for improved responsiveness
- **Seamless sound restart behavior** - sounds can be retriggered instantly without audio gaps
- **`--debug` launch flag** for beta testers - enables detailed debug logging in production builds
- Comprehensive tracing instrumentation for audio hotpaths (playback, decoding, caching)
- Performance logging for device enumeration timing (avg ~235ms)
- Performance logging for waveform generation timing (linear scaling ~1.4ms/second)
- Sample rate conversion logging for quality analysis (INFO-level when resampling occurs)
- Dry-run mode for `sync-version.js` script with `--dry-run` flag
- SemVer validation to `sync-version.js` to prevent invalid version formats

### Changed
- **Product rebranding**: Officially renamed to "SonicDeck" (removed space from "Sonic Deck")
- Data directory consolidation for cleaner file organization
- Updated all markdown documentation and branding materials to reflect new name
- Bug report template now requests `--debug` flag usage for better diagnostics

### Fixed
- System tray close behavior now works correctly
- Hotkeys are now automatically removed when deleting associated sounds
- Atomic JSON persistence prevents corrupted settings files on write failures
- Multi-channel audio device mapping (5.1, 7.1 surround) now correctly routes to stereo output
- Hotkey display normalization: "Digit" and "Key" prefixes properly formatted

### Performance
- Memoized `SoundButton` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders (50+ buttons → only 1 re-renders on click)
- Comprehensive performance instrumentation across audio pipeline
- Background audio decoding prevents UI blocking

### Technical
- Added structured logging with `tracing` crate throughout audio pipeline
- Implemented non-blocking file logging with daily rotation (7-day retention)
- Enhanced error handling and logging for device enumeration failures
- Improved audio stream creation with detailed timing metrics
- CLI argument parsing for runtime debug mode control

### Known Issues
- Hotkey multi-trigger on rapid key press (minimal cooldown of 15ms implemented)

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- Centralized version management system (single source of truth)
- Dynamic version display in app via `VITE_APP_VERSION` environment variable
- Pre-commit hook for automatic version synchronization across config files
- `sync-version.js` script for maintaining version consistency
- `VERSION.md` documentation for version management workflow

### Changed
- Build process now automatically syncs versions in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `tauri.conf.json`
- Build scripts (`yarn build`, `yarn tauri:dev`, `yarn tauri:build`) now include automatic version sync

### Fixed
- Add comprehensive error handling (try-catch) to `sync-version.js` for robust file I/O
- Fix TOML regex to target only `[package]` section, preventing accidental dependency version changes
- Fix `vite.config.ts` path bug (`../version.json` → `./version.json`)
- Fix MSI build failure by implementing dual-version system (numeric build version for MSI compatibility)

### Technical
- Implement ESM-compatible version sync script with helper functions
- Add `VITE_APP_VERSION` and `VITE_APP_CHANNEL` injection in `vite.config.ts`
- Implement dual-version system: numeric build version (MSI-compatible) + alphanumeric display version (user-friendly)
- Add smart version display logic in `SettingsAbout.tsx` (converts `0.7.0-0` + `alpha` → `v0.7.0-alpha`)
- Update pre-commit hooks to stage synced version files automatically
- Replace hardcoded version in `SettingsAbout.tsx` with environment variable

### Known Issues
- Hotkey multi-trigger on rapid key press (Fix planned for v0.7.3 or v0.8.0)
- UI click has artificial delay (Fix planned for v0.7.3)
- System tray close behavior inconsistent (Fix planned for v0.7.3)
